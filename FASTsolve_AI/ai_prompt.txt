Write a C program to compute the determinant of a matrix and solve a system of linear equations using Cramer’s Rule.
Use dynamic memory allocation for 2D and 1D arrays and fill the matrix with random values using srand() / random().
Create multiple child processes using fork() to parallelize the determinant computations, compare it with the sequential implementation, and measure execution time and speedup achieved.
